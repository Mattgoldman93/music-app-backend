### About
this repo provides the 'back end' of a music collection single page web application, hosted at: [here](https://github.com/Mattgoldman93/music-app-frontend). The git hub repository for the front end can be found [here](https://github.com/Mattgoldman93/music-app-frontend).
The purpose of this repo is to determine which requests are processed, what the response will be and additionally, it stores the data necessary for the app to function. The app allows users to record their physical music collection and keep track of it. The user is able to create, delete, edit or display the records.

Tech used includes postgresql, ruby, ruby on rails and heroku

In future updates to the back end I would like to:

- remove genre/ add format
- add songs entity to belong to albums
- incorporate spotify api for auto-completion and
